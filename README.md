# DWS202 DDP Project

Project for DWS MSc Program's course named "Distributed Data Processing" (DWS202).

## About
This Docker project simulates a distributed environment by serving two separate Redis database instances. It creates two datasets and populates one in the first Redis instance and the second in the second instance. It implements Hash Join and Semi Join functions outside of the databases and provides a comparison between the different implementations. By leveraging Docker, this project ensures a consistent and isolated setup for running the Redis instances and executing the join operations. This setup allows for a practical exploration of distributed data processing techniques and the performance implications of different join strategies in a simulated environment.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
1. **Users**: Contains columns `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `registration_timestamp`. The `user_id` column serves as the primary key.

2. **Orders**: Contains columns `order_id`, `user_id`, `product`, `order_timestamp`. The `user_id` column serves as a foreign key referencing the user_id in the Users dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Setup and Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2. **Configure the .env file**:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3. **Build and start the Docker containers**:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Usage
- The project scripts will automatically handle the dataset creation, loading into Redis, and executing the join operations.

- Check the console output for the results of the join operations and the comparison between different implementations.

## ENV file notes
- **DO NOT CHANGE** the following values:
    ```plaintext
    REDIS_HOST1=redis_db1
    REDIS_HOST2=redis_db2
    REDIS_PORT1=6379
    REDIS_PORT2=6380
    REDIS_DEFAULT_INTERNAL_PORT=6379
    ```
- `NUM_OF_USERS`: Declare the total number of users that will be generated. Each user will have between 0 to 10 orders generated by the script.

- If you want to run the script with the example dataset that is in the `dataset` directory, adjust these values:
    ```plaintext
    USERS_IN_DOCKER_PATH=/app/dataset/users_table_example.csv
    ORDERS_IN_DOCKER_PATH=/app/dataset/orders_table_example.csv
    ```
